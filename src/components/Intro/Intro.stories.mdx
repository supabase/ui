# Introduction

## An open-source UI component library inspired by Tailwind and AntDesign.

Supabase UI is a high level UI component library with a focus on creating beutiful apps quickly and efficiently. We designed Supabase UI to be used along with Tailwind CSS utlity classes.

## Vision

We have compiled repeatable UI patterns into components that we see in everyday apps that we need to use repeatably.

We are also trying to implement Supabase specific components, so that that Supabase can be used quickly and interacted with easily.

## Key Features

### Tailwind friendly

We have tried to compile a group of aesthetically pleasing components with design inspiration from existing UI libraries and also Tailwind UI examples.

We also try to allow tailwind css classes be used for animations and we strongly encourage you to use a tailwind config with Supabase UI.

### Open source

The whole library is open source, and we are trying to integrate other open source projects into this library if we can.

### Uncontrolled

All components have been designed so they can be used controlled and uncontrolled. We have gone to some effort in making sure that you don't need to keep local states for unessaary things but rather provide callbacks for useful interactions or state changes.

### Developer experience

We have tried to keep the library fully typed where possible, it is an ongoing effort.

### WAI ARIA

We are trying to make our components adhere to the [WAI-ARIA design patterns](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2). We would like to see Supabase UI handle aria and role attributes, focus management and also keyboard navigation.
